# Battle of Britain
- Germany's Luftwaffe vs. Royal Air Force (RAF)
- Hoped to weaken Britain so they could invade
- Bombing campaign against major cities to decrease British morale
- British were able to prevent a German land invasion
- Britain's early radar helped predict bombings
    - Confedential at first so the "Carrot is good for eyes" was setup
